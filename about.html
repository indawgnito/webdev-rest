            The frameworks used to create this web application are vue js, and foundation css.
            Vue js helped us to layout javascript code and css together in one file as well as the 
            the capability to make components such as the modal for adding new crimes in our application.
            Foundation css was useful for styling and centering our elements as well as keeping a theme
            of how we wanted our pages layed out.
            We created a RESTful server api to retrieve crime data from an sqlite 
            database of crimes committed around Saint Paul. We used the leaflet js api to layout the map
            and to create markers on the map. Lastly,

          <ul class="team-member-box"> Six Interesting Findings from the application:
            <li></li>
            <li>One: Capitol river has the highest number of crimes from the top 1000 crimes in the database.</li>
            <li>Two: A large proportion of submitted incidents reported were proactive police visits.</li>
            <li>Three: Many of the crimes from the Union Park neighborhood around Saint Thomas were thefts.</li>
            <li>Four: We didn't know that there were 17 distinct neighborhoods around Saint Paul.</li>
            <li>Five: Violent crimes are relatively rare being the rarest group of crimes.</li>
            <li>Six: There really isn't much of a pattern for what type of crime will occur at what time.</li>
